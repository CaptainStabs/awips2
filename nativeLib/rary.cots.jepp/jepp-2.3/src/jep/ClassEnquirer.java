/**
 * <pre>
 * ClassEnquirer.java - Interface to enquire if a name is available
 * to be imported from Java.  Used by JEP's importer hook (PEP 302) to
 * determine if an attempt to import a module/class should be directed
 * to the Python importer or the Java importer.
 * 
 * TODO: Implement an OSGi class enquirer.  Implement a pseudo-secure
 * class enquirer.  jep.findClass(name) ignores the import hook and wouldn't
 * go through the secure enquirer, so it would still require a restricted
 * ClassLoader to be secure.  However, they could potentially be used in
 * tandem for faster performance or dynamic behavior.
 * 
 * TODO Potentially add a method to get a list of sub-packages.  However,
 * for the most part that won't work for any implementations except ClassList
 * so perhaps it shouldn't be on the interface.

     * Whether or not this ClassEnquirer supports importing Java classes at the

     * ClassLoader JEP should always be able to successfully import Java classes
     * with syntax such as:
     * 
     * <p>
     * <blockquote>
     * 
     * <pre>
     * from java.util import ArrayList
     * o = ArrayList()
     * 
     * </p>
     * </blockquote></pre>
     * 
     * However, only in some scenarios can the package be imported separately
     * without the fully qualified name, such as:
     * 
     * <p>
     * <blockquote>
     * 
     * <pre>
     * import java.util as ju
     * o = ju.ArrayList()
     * 
     * </p>
     * </blockquote></pre>
     * 
     * This also roughly corresponds to whether or not dir(javaPackage) will
     * return a list of available classes or only the classes that have been
     * explicitly imported.
     * 
     * @return true if this ClassEnquirer supports import of packages in
     *         addition to import of classes, false if it only supports
     *         importing classes.
