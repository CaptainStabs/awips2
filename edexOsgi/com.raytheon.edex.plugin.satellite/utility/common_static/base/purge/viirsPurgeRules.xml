        VIIRS imagery purge rules.
   -->
   <!-- TOWRdocs Description
        Purge rule options are added for VIIRS NPP data. This sets purging of data that have been ingested into 
        edex and are stored in the HDF5 Data Store and PostgreSQL Metadata Store. 
   -->                                                                
   <!-- TOWRdocs Status
        This is an addition of VIIRS HDF5 Data Store/PostgreSQL Metadata Store purge rules not found in the
        current baseline. It sets VIIRS data files to purge every 1 day (01-00:00:00). 
        The rule can be modified to purge by version, which is sometimes helpful when testing with manually
	ingested files.
