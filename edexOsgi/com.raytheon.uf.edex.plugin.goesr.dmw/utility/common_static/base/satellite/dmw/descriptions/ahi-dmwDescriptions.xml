    <!-- TOWRdocs Description
        This file contains multiple ProductDescription instances relating to the 
        GOES-R Derived Motion Winds (DMW) plugin. It provides the framework for
        mapping NetCDF-4 Variables/Attributes/Values to DMWRecord fields, which allows
        for and handles the decoding of DMW files into AWIPS II EDEX.

            See com.raytheon.uf.edex.plugin.goesr.dmw.description.ProductDescription.java for more information.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Description of Tags ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        <description>
            Specifies the beginning of a new product description. Each new description must
            contain the tags described below (unless noted otherwise). Each product description
            is closed off with the closing </description> tag.

        <lat>
            The "Latitude" Variable

        <lon>
            The "Longitude" Variable

        <wspd>
            The "Wind Speed" Variable

        <wdir>
            The "Wind Direction" Variable

        <dqf>
            The "Data Quality Flag" Variable. This maps the NetCDF Variable that handles the
            "quality" of each observation (good obs, bad because ______, etc.)

        <percentGoodDQF>
            Variable (For Himawari ONLY) that maps the percentage
            of winds observations that have a "good obs" quality flag associated.

            NOTE: This is an optional variable. If not specified, the decoder will still attempt to
                        decode files even though they may have no valid DQF values (DQF=0).

                        Perhaps the best example of this would be if you are interested ingesting
                        winds that may have failed a certain verification test.

                        **IMPORTANT** - If this is your case, be sure to modify the <validDQF> tag
                                to match the DQF You are interested in!

        <validDQF>
            User-set variable that determines which DQF to use to create a DMW Record.
            This value is default at 0 ("good observation"), but may be altered to ingest
            other-quality winds into the database.

            NOTE: DMWRecords will only be created for observations with a DWF value
                        matching the one provided. This means that multiple <description> 
                        entries will be required to view more than just winds with a DQF=0
                        (one entry per desired "DQF")

        <filter>
            The Variable that determines what value to insert into the "filter" column for a
            DMWRecord. This defaults to pressure for DMWs (for altitude-based querying) but
            realistically may be expanded to handle other NetCDF Variables in the same file.

        <channel>
            The Variable that maps the "Channel Number" of the satellite associated with
            the observation

        <orbitalSlot>
            A User-set value for the "Orbital Slot". This maps to a String, and it is defaulted to 
            "Himawari", as there is no "Orbital Slot" Variable/Attribute in Himawari DMW files.

            This may be used in combination with validDQF above to create custom Orbital Slot
            Strings, which may allow for DQF-based display and bundling in CAVE

                i.e. <orbitalSlotValue value="HimawariDQF6" /> paired with <validDQF>6</validDQF>

        <scene>
            A User-set value for the "Scene". This maps to a String, and it is defaulted to 
            "Himawari", as there is no "Scene" Variable/Attribute in Himawari DMW files.

            Much like with <orbitalSlotValue>, This may be modified by the user to allow for more
            control when building CAVE bundles.

        <dataTime>
            Variable used to represent the "Time" Variable/Attribute of the NetCDF File. There may
            be several Variables/Attributes that handle times or dates inside a single file.

            However, for this specific entry we are interested in the Variable/Attribute that handles
            "time in seconds since the specified epoch date", or something of the like.

                attribute "epoch" - the epoch date specified in the Variable
                    MUST be in the form "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"

                attribute "units" - defaulted to SECONDS, as Himawari files provide the offset in
                    seconds.

                <variable>
                    The name of the actual NetCDF Variable that holds the time we are interested in.

        <debug>
            This tag handles the verbose error logging specific to the <description> tag in which it
            is specified. It is not a required tag (will automatically default to false).

            If set to true and the description causes an error when creating a database entry, a 
            description of that error will be logged in "/awips2/edex/logs/edex-ingest-yyyyMMDD.log".

            NOTE: Because the DMW plugin now handles both GOES-R and Himawari DMWs, at 
                    least one product description will fail and throw and error (running a GOES-R description 
                    on a Himawari file, and vice versa). Because of this, it is only suggested to use 

                        <debug>true</debug> 

                    when creating/modifying new or existing product descriptions. Otherwise you will see errors propogating
                    through the logs even though valid DMWRecords are being created and ingested properly.
