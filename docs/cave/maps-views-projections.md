## Default Map Scales

   * **N. Hemisphere** (North Polar Stereographic)
   * **Regional** (for the selected localization site)
   * **WFO** (for the selected localization site)
   * **World Mercator**
   * **World CED**

   * **Regional** Mercator projections for **Africa**, **Australia/NZ**, **South America**, **Europe**, **Alaska**, **Hawaii**, **Puerto Rico**, **Japan**, **Pacific Ocean**, and the north and south poles.

There is also a **WFO** submenu which contains a map scale for every NWS localization site.
