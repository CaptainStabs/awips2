## Export KML

**File > Export > KML**

The "Export" submenu also includes a "KML" option, which allows users to save D2D displays or
GFE grids in the KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file format. When zipped (compressed), the KML
file format forms a KMZ file, which can be used in applications such as Google Earth.

The KML dialog box includes options to select frames to export. This includes exporting all frames,
the current/displayed frame, a range of frames, and, in GFE, the selected time range as highlighted in
the Grid Manager. Additional options are available for selection under the "Other Options" section:

* **Export Hidden**: When selected, all displayed and hidden products listed in the Product Legend section of the Main Display Pane will be exported.

* **Export Maps**: When selected, all enabled maps displayed within the Main Display Pane will be
exported.

* **Shade Earth**: When selected, a shaded background is applied to the exported product. If loaded in Google Earth, the earth will be overlaid with a black backdrop, and data will be displayed as it would in D2D with a black background.

* **Show Background Tiles**: When selected, data (such as plot data) will display on top of black
tiles when loaded in Google Earth.
