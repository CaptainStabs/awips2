         GOES-R index menu file.

    <!-- TOWRdocs Description
         The previous baseline menu provided the option to have GOES-R products appear as a button in the CAVE near the 
         top, or for GOES-R menus to be found farther down, within the Satellites menu button.  The active code
         in the baseline activates the latter.  
         
   If choosing to install after the satellite menu ("after=satellite"):  For some WFOs, radar
   buttons are appearing between the Satellite and GOES-R buttons, and the reason is the baseline has them
   set to also install just after Satellite.  If this occurs, the index xml file for radar can be changed to
   install after GOES-R.  Instructions to do this are:

    Go into the Localization view in CAVE. Navigate under the Localization view to:

      -CAVE - menus - Radar - index.xml - CONFIGURED (site_name)

   Copy the file index.xml - CONFIGURED (site_name) to the site level so it can be edited.
   In that file, do a search and replace on "after=satellite." This will appear in each
   entry for which there is a radar button in CAVE.  Replace this expression with "after=goesr"
   in each place it appears.  It is important to keep the case correct (goesr, no hyphen between
   the s and r).  This instruction assumes that GOES-R appears as a button in the menu at the top,
   which this configuration file sets.  Restart the CAVE and the radar buttons should appear after
   the GOES-R button. 

   In the latest implementation below, goesr is included within the d2d satellite menu.

    <!-- TOWRdocs Status
         This uncomments a section of code that is included in the baseline menu file, to form a GOES-R menu selection button.
         which appears under the Satellite button.
