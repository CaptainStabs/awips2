        Himawari Derived Motion Winds (DMW) menu index file.
    -->
    <!-- TOWRdocs Description
        File that provides a menu index (for subsequent DMW menus/bundles) to the "Himawari" menu in AWIPS II. 
        The index references the menu-item file "ahi-dmwFilterMenu.xml". Essentially, this file is saying 

            "install 'ahi-dmwFilterMenu.xml' to the Himawari menu"
        
        in AWIPS II.
