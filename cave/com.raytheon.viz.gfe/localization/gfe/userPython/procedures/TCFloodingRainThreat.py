# Author: lefebvre,santos
# Last Modified: April 4, 2012 - Fixed to handle negative gridded FFG.
# Migrated procedure for AWIPS2. Updated 6/22/2012.   S.O.
# 
# Comment on 05/21/2014 (Santos): Some sites used QPF and others QPF6hr. Check that parameter 
# in getQPFGrid method. Also in AWIPS 2 FFG is gridded and called just FFG. 
# This is fixed in getRFCFFGModels method.
#
# LeFevbre/Santos: This is the version being turned in for baseline in 16.1.2 as of 12/7/2015. It includes fixes
#for new ERP data changes that took place in Summer of 2015 and better handling of grid points where there
#is no FFG guidance available.
# Last Modified
# 7/15/2016 - Lefebvre/Santos: working on code to add PQPF to the algorithm.
# 9/2/2016 - Lefebvre/Santos: Finished integrating {QPF into the algorithm
# 9/7/2016 - Lefebvre/Santos: Added better logic for grid missing messages and Don't use guidance option.
# 9/7/2016 - Lefebvre/Santos: Change ppffg timeRanges to anchor on 12Z cycles. 
# VERSION 17.1.1 = The one checked in.
# 11/14/2016 - Santos - Modified at testbed in Silver Springs to fix overlap variable to do the composite
# of the rfc list edit areas, not just the overlap with cwa mask. Commented out statusBarMsg for the ppffg inventories.
# 07/21/2017 - Tweaked for 2018 baseline (17.3.1) based on WPC recommendations following upcoming change in ERPs 
# to neighborhood based probabilities. Check 2018 version of HTI User Guide for details. PS/TL
# 8/31/2017 - Fixed issues found during Harvey when FFG was zero across large chunks of the area. PS/TL
# 10/21/2017 - Additional tweaks made per Raytheon suggestions during code review. (DR20333)
# 11/14/2017 - Fixed ERP thresholds per WPC recommendations during SWiT. Fixed also minimum value allowed for
# FFG guidance in GFE D2D FFGXXX db to treat NO DATA or exception values as negative in GFE. This change was made in
# the RFCFFGParameterInfo file. Otherwise logic below would not work.
